# Agent Library — SOUL.md Personas

The `agents/` directory at the repo root is a curated library of 200+ agent personas. Each persona is a `SOUL.md` file — a structured system prompt that defines an agent's identity, operating principles, and output format.

## Structure

```
agents/
└── <category>/
    └── <agent-name>/
        └── SOUL.md
```

Every directory name is part of the slug. `agents/development/code-reviewer/SOUL.md` is addressable as `@development/code-reviewer`.

## Using a Persona (@slug syntax)

Reference a persona anywhere you'd write a system prompt:

```bash
# Flag format (-system)
ofp-playground start \
  --agent "-provider anthropic -name Alice -system @creative/brand-designer"

# Colon format (description field)
ofp-playground start \
  --agent "anthropic:Alice:@creative/brand-designer"

# Mix multiple agents
ofp-playground start \
  --agent "anthropic:Alice:@development/code-reviewer" \
  --agent "google:Bob:@development/bug-hunter"
```

The `@slug` is resolved at agent construction time by [`src/ofp_playground/agents/library.py`](../src/ofp_playground/agents/library.py), which reads the SOUL.md file and substitutes its content as the system prompt. The full library is cached for the process lifetime.

```bash
ofp-playground agents    # list all available slugs
```

## `development/` — Coding-Aware Personas

The `development/` category contains personas with embedded software engineering methodology (TDD, systematic debugging, verification discipline). These are used automatically by coding agents when no system prompt is provided.

| Slug | Auto-loaded by | What it encodes |
|------|---------------|-----------------|
| `@development/coding-agent` | `BaseCodingAgent` (all providers) | Senior dev identity; Red-Green-Refactor rhythm; 4-phase debugging; verification-before-done contract |
| `@development/tdd-expert` | — | Iron Law (no prod code without failing test); RED/GREEN/REFACTOR cycle; rationalizations table |
| `@development/technical-planner` | — | File-first decomposition; bite-sized tasks; no-placeholders rule; YAGNI |
| `@development/tech-lead` | — | Decompose→delegate→review→integrate; two-stage review (spec + quality); quality gates |
| `@development/code-reviewer` | — | Plan alignment review; architecture checklist; when-to-invoke methodology; review output format |
| `@development/bug-hunter` | — | 4-phase systematic debugging; root-cause-before-fix; 3-fix architectural trigger |
| `@development/test-writer` | — | TDD core; red-green-refactor steps; test quality checklist |
| `@development/qa-tester` | — | Verification before completion; 5-step gate; evidence before assertions |
| `@development/pr-merger` | — | Branch completion options; git worktrees guide; safety rules |

## Writing a New Persona

Create the directory and file:

```
agents/<category>/<agent-name>/SOUL.md
```

The file format is free-form Markdown. The library loader extracts the display name from the first meaningful heading (strips `# `, `SOUL.md — `, `Agent: ` prefixes). There is no required frontmatter.

The slug is immediately available without any registration step — the library rescans on the next process start (or call `ofp_playground.agents.library.load.cache_clear()` in tests to force a reload).

## Loading API

```python
from ofp_playground.agents.library import load, resolve_slug

# Full index: {slug: {slug, category, name, display_name, content}}
index = load()

# Resolve a single slug to its SOUL.md content
system_prompt = resolve_slug("@development/code-reviewer")
```
